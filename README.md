The [**`UITOTO`**](https://github.com/atorresgalvis/UITOTO)
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) package addresses the challenges
associated with finding, testing, and visualizing reliable Diagnostic
Molecular Combinations (DMCs), especially those arising from
high-throughput taxonomy. The package also features a user-friendly
[Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) App that can be accessed
[online](https://atorresgalvis.shinyapps.io/MolecularDiagnoses/) or
locally in [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).

## Pre-Installation

You may need to complete a pre-installation process to ensure your
environment is configured with the prerequisites required for
[**`UITOTO`**](https://github.com/atorresgalvis/UITOTO) installation.
The complete list of packages from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
required by [**`UITOTO`**](https://github.com/atorresgalvis/UITOTO)
could be provided by typing in [R](https://www.r-project.org/):

``` r
packages <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "seqinr", "shiny", "shinyjs", "shinyWidgets")
```

Afterward, you can install the packages that have not yet been installed
all at once with:

``` r
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
}
```

As [**`UITOTO`**](https://github.com/atorresgalvis/UITOTO) uses some
packages from [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) (Biostrings
and DECIPHER), it is highly recommended to follow the instructions
included in <https://www.bioconductor.org/install/>. The BiocManager
package is used for managing
[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) resources, so to get it you
should use:

``` r
# Updated to 17/04/2024.
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.18")
```

After that, you can install
[Biostrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html):

``` r
BiocManager::install("Biostrings")
```

As well as the
[DECIPHER](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DECIPHER.html)
package:

``` r
BiocManager::install("DECIPHER")
```

Now you should be ready to install
[**`UITOTO`**](https://github.com/atorresgalvis/UITOTO). However, it is
advisable to restart the RStudio session or simply close and reopen the
program.

## Installation

Now that everything is ready, you have to ways for installing the
package. You can install the released version of
[**`UITOTO`**](https://github.com/atorresgalvis/UITOTO) from
<a href="https://github.com/"><img src="https://github.com/atorresgalvis/UITOTO/blob/main/inst/app/www/img/github-icon-mini.png (Github)" alt="" width="3%"></a> with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("atorresgalvis/UITOTO")
```

Then, you should load the package into your work session:

``` r
library(UITOTO)
```

## Get Started

- Running the [**`UITOTO`**](https://github.com/atorresgalvis/UITOTO)
  Shiny app locally:

  ``` r
  runUITOTO()
  ```

  **IMPORTANT:** By default, users of [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/)
  apps can only upload files up to 5 MB. You can increase this limit by
  setting the option before executing the
  [**`UITOTO`**](https://github.com/atorresgalvis/UITOTO) shiny app. For
  example, to allow up to 12 MB use:

  ``` r
  options(shiny.maxRequestSize = 12 * 1024^2)
  #And then run the UITOTO shiny app normally
  runUITOTO()
  ```

- Find Diagnostic Molecular Combinations (DMCs)

  You could use the module *Find DMCs* of the
  [**`UITOTO`**](https://atorresgalvis.shinyapps.io/MolecularDiagnoses/)
  Shiny app for identifying reliable DMCs. However, for very
  time-consuming searches, the command-driven version is strongly
  recommended. For this, you will need to use the `OpDMC` function.

  ``` r
  OpDMC("FastaFile.fasta", 
        "SpeciesList.csv", 
        iter = 20000, 
        MnLen = 4, 
        exclusive = 4, 
        RefStrength = 0.25, 
        OutName = "OpDMC_output.csv", 
        GapsNew = FALSE
  )
  ```

  Note well that the
  [**`UITOTO`**](https://atorresgalvis.shinyapps.io/MolecularDiagnoses/)
  Shiny app can also function as a scripter. This means you donâ€™t have
  to worry about the syntax of the commands; you simply need to drag the
  files and modify the settings using mouse-only navigation. The app
  will then automatically display the equivalent
  [R](https://www.r-project.org/) commands based on the actions you
  performed visually:
